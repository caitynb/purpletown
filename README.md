# purpletown
This is the code for the project Purpletown, in which I am aggregating the data available from the NYT to find places in the United States with slim voting margins. The process only works for the GEOID columns that have names, and the numbers are currently a work in progress. This project is under the supervision of Paul Shabroom of the Art Department at the University of Minnesota.
